// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Spawning sub-system (Kimo's Systems/Spawning.fs analog) — owns
// the spawn queue, the weighted table picks, and its own RNG
// stream (seeded by the caller — never shared with other systems).
// Waves composes WHAT a wave contains; Spawning executes it.
//
// Deliberately no capacity/respawn invariant: Kimo's zone capacity
// + EntityDied→respawn serves ambient spawns; TD waves are finite
// batches. Death/arrival handling lives in Enemies (events out).
