// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// VFX sub-system — the ONE deliberately non-adaptive system in the
// world (plan §4.10): per-particle adaptive cells would be node
// churn for fire-and-forget presentation. Pooled particles pattern
// (Mibo pooled-particles), one pool per effect kind — each kind
// draws with its own texture in a single .particles call.
//
// Kinds and their look (kenney_smoke_particles / particle_pack):
//   Impact   → spark_01      — tight, fast-fading sparks at the hit
//   Explosion→ explosion03   — a clustered fireball: quick fade
//   DeathPoof→ blackSmoke05  — slow puffs that EXPAND, rise, linger
//   Muzzle   → flash00       — a single stationary flash at the barrel
//   Placement→ dirt_01       — low dust clumps that settle fast
//   BaseHit  → blackSmoke05  — a bigger smoke cloud at the base
//
// The motion model is per-kind (paramsOf): velocity DAMPING stalls
// the spray near the origin (no more fly-away balls), RISE drifts
// smoke upward, and GROWTH expands puffs as they fade — the classic
// smoke look. Deterministic bursts — no RNG stream (index-based
// angles/speed tiers; golden-angle rotation spread).
//
// Texture handles are resolved ONCE and cached on the raylib view
// (VfxView): the per-frame `assets.Texture(string)` calls were flagged
// by the trace (string allocation per call). The cache is presentation
// state (asset handles, not adaptive reads), so it lives at the view
// edge and the sim carries only backend-neutral particle data.
